Spelljammer meets Asheron's Call meets Star Citizen

Spacefarer is a Mass Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) intended to bring several styles of gameplay into one common game.
A Dungeons & Dragons game, Spelljammer, introduced the fantastical way of allowing players to transform ordinary shipping vessels into
space travelling ships, capable of traversing the planets and the travelling between the multiverse known as the Crystal Spheres. A 
difference from other styles of gaming was implemented in Asheron's Call that allows the player to control how experience is used to
specialize each individual ability and skill level. In regards to Star Citizen, multiple styles of gameplay are available -- crafting, 
adventuring, ship-to-ship combat, privateering, and PVPing.
